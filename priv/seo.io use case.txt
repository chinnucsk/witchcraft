==Use Case 1==
=BuenaCarta wants 20 sites=

Actors:

  BCO: BuenaCarta's owner
  WRx: Writer x
  EDx: Editor x
  USR: An annonymous web user
  SEO: SEO.io

Story:

  1.  BCO asks SEO to fill his 20 domains providing 200 keywords through SEO's **Client-UI**
  2.  Given the keywords, SEO uses its **Topic Generator** to create plausible article topics for each domain
  3.  SEO pushes new topics to its **Article Queue**
  3.  SEO uses its **Mailer** to send a mail to every writer telling him about the new needed articles
  4.  WR1 opens SEO's **Writer-UI** and chooses an article topic to write about
  5.  WR1 uses SEO's **Article-Editor** to write (or just paste) his new article [he can save as many drafts as he want, close and reopen the browser without loosing his data]
  6.  WR1 decides the article is done, and then submits it using SEO's **Writer-UI**
  7.  SEO uses its **Mailer** to send a mail to every editor telling him about the new submitted article
  8.  ED1 opens SEO's **Editor-UI** and chooses an article to check
  9.  ED1 modifies the article using SEO's **Article-Editor** [again: saving, closing, reopening, etc... is allowed]
  10. ED1 rejects the article and adds a reason for that on SEO's **Editor-UI**
  11. SEO uses its **Mailer** to send a mail to WR1 telling him about the rejection of his article
  12. WR1 opens SEO's **Writer-UI** and, using the **Article-Editor**, corrects the article.  Then he submits it again
  13. SEO uses its **Mailer** to send a mail to every editor telling him about the new submitted article
  14. ED1 opens the article in SEO's **Editor-UI** and publishes it
  15. SEO enables the corresponding domain on its **DNS Server**
  16. SEO uses its **Mailer** to send a mail to BCO telling him about the new published article
  17. USR tries to reach the site using his browser
  18. USR's browser queries SEO's **DNS Server** for the domain
  19. SEO's **DNS Server** returns the ip of one of its **Web Servers**
  20. USR's browser navigates to the given ip
  21. SEO's **Web Server** formats the corresponding article and returns it to USR

Notes:

  1.  SEO should keep track of article history (with article status and contents)
  2.  On step 13... is it OK to notify every editor or should only ED1 be notified?
  3.  Of course, USR may also be Google Crawler
  4.  We need a way to let BCO pay for SEO's services

We may need:

  - To give BCO a way to check the status of his domains (with some kind of stats or something)
  - To generate stats or reports about the quality of WRx articles (We can even check how many people read them)
  - To give USR a chance to add comments
  - To let BCO (or WRx? or EDx?) choose themes/skins for the domains/articles
